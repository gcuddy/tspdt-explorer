What I really want is to make this super fast, all the data downloaded and locally available. And you can just quickly navigate through it. See a movie's profile and get more data visualization type stuff with a chart charting it's position over the years. It also makes sense as a ssr app. I think I'm going to make a new branch that moves it to be more speed-focused. The ideal is that it works as a ssr website without js. And then it can also download everything and work offline really well and be a little app you use. It's both! Is that possible.

14:00 tbh maybe it does make sense to crawl the whole 20k films and get the tmdb data for them. then we can just _have_ it. can update when viewing a director page or whatever.

Will be cool to have a checkbox system, like the old icheckmovies. Would be nice to sync with Letterboxd - maybe just by uploading your csv it can do that. And then badges, quests, progress bars etc â€” for tspdt, 21st century, etc. I'm basically rebuilding icheckmovies but a lot nicer lol. That wasn't my intention but maybe is worth doing.
