Some more todos:

- Implement streaming with loading.js or whatever next.js wants me to do
- Try out using replicache to get data fast and locally available

Trying to hook up replicache. Seeing SST Console store and the crazy type stuff they're doing is cool. But going to try to keep it simple for now.

Struggling with my command bar I built. Use effects causing infinte loops. I've built too many command bars, should probably just use cmdk, but I liked SST Console's idea of bar.register etc. I guess I could probably build something like that with cmdk too. Idk.
