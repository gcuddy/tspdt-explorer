03:21 finally got a working sqlite thing. using turso.not much to show for it. bed now. going to think through this... should each movie component be responsibile for fetching tmdb data? that could work, but might add up quick... maybe want a trpc endpoint to help out with stuff.

15:00 tempted to make this way fancier than it needs to be. looking at trpc, replicache, servers, etc. all because i saw some stuff about making fast spas. but realistically this can and should probably be a simple website that just uses server components.

Okay, got things loosely working. Going to keep it simple: the goals are to list the movies, make a director page as well. And then have a search/filter component. That's it!
