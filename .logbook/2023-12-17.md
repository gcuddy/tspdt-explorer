Forgot about the rankings with what I was working with! Lol.

Goal will be to take the starting list as is, transform that into csv that parses out directors, and also parses out rankings. These should be their own table. Use tableplus to build this with a local database, using drizzle to maintain the schema. Then generate a sql file, and feed that into Cloudflare D1, switching up to that. Think that will be the best course of action. Actually, for now can just do my testing with the local sqlite databse, I'm fine with that!
